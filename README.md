# UnRealistic-Fox-Origin
A custom-made fox origin mod's expansion for Minecraft Fabric Origins Mod.
Language available: Simplified Chinese & English

**Needs Fabric**

**Needs Origins Mod, Pehkui Mod, Fabric api mod and ThDilos' Custom Fox Origin mod to function**

Fabric: https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/

Fabric API Mod: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api

Origins Mod: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins

Pehkui Mod: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pehkui

ThDilos' Custom Fox Origin Mod: https://github.com/ThDilos/Realistic-Fox-Origin

This is my second time writing a mod.

Technically it's not a mod, cuz I created it the same way I did with my first "mod".

Therefore, in case something breaks, you can add in the comment section, if there's any...
Do not expect much from me cuz I'm now less-new to any of these

Til this day I still dk how github works

May add more elementary fox in the future, if I have time. 
Not likely to happen cuz uni is starting.

Anyways, hope you have fun with this mod ;)

###################################################################################

**I tried to recall everything I've added to this origin, maybe there are ones I forget about.**

###################################################################################

Added Origin:
Lightning Fox
**Unchoosable**
Activated by pressing [Load Hotbar Activator](default is 'x') after damaged by lightning for 32 times (a message will show in the chat box once achieved)
Form switching has a cooldown of 30s
Cooldown Indicator On

-Active Skill 1
	**Discharge**
	[Active abilityï¼Œdouble tap and hold [Sneaking] to charge, press [Sprinting] to activate.]
    
	Cooldown 10s
	Cooldown Indicator On

	Sneak to charge a 5s bar.
	When at 1.67s, reach Charge Level I;
	When at 3.33s, reach Charge Level II;
	When at 5s, reach Charge level III

	Press [Sprinting] key (Default is Ctrl) to release an AOE attack when at different charge levels.
	
	Charge Level I:
	Summon lightning_bolt in radius of 9 blocks.
	Deal 10 damage with damage type lightning_bolt to entities within 10 blocks.
	Apply 10 exhaustion.

	Charge Level II:
	Summon lightning_bolt in radius of 19 blocks.
	Deal 20 damage with damage type lightning_bolt to entities within 20 blocks.
	Apply 20 exhaustion.

	Charge Level III:
	Summon lightning_bolt in radius of 19 blocks.
	Deal 50 damage with damage type lightning_bolt to entities within 20 blocks.
	Apply 40 exhaustion.
	You start shaking.
	You start glowing.

	After discharge, you get blindness 1 and slowness 1 for 1 second. (Faint effect lol)
	
	When you move, charge is disrupted.
	When you get hit, charge is disrupted.
	When you get hit by not projectile, while reaching a charge level, deal half of the damage(5,10,25) to the attacker and trigger CD.
	
	When you reached a charge level, damage mobs in 2 blocks radius by (2,4,4 damage).
	When you reached a charge level, give slowness 3 to all entities within range(10,20,20 blocks).
	When you reached a charge level, give glowing to all entities within range(10,20,20 blocks).

	This skill can only be used if foodlevel > 0.

	All the lightning_bolts summoned are killed right after, and all the fires are extinguished. To protect the environment yeah, not because fire is like 150% more deadly to fox origins and it'd be awkward to commit a funny at the moment.

-Active Skill 2
	**Become Lightning**
	[Activate by pressing secondary use key]

	Mode change cooldown 1s
	Cooldown Indicator On

	Press Secondary use key to enable lightning mode:
	Player model become more transparent but still visible.
	A blue-ish screen overlay.
	Climbing enabled in air, like you are constantly in a ladder.
	Swimming enabled in air, with swim speed increased by 1000%. (Dolphins Grace effect is disabled cuz it'd be very op in this mode)
	Base exhaustion increased by 1900%, with a constant exhaustion of 0.1 per tick.

	When swimming past an entity in 3 blocks, summon lightning on them and apply 8 damage(this may not work cuz damage tick exists)
	When swimming constantly replace fire with air in 3 blocks radius. (protect the environment),also fire may still exist after you summoned lightning_bolt, you can just swim back and extinguish them.

	When in water, takes 2 damage.
	Can be delayed by enchantment "water_protection"

	Make nearby 50 blocks mobs glow for you:
	Hostle mobs/Endermen/Wolves/Polar bears glow red
	Players glow blue
	Foxes glow green
	Other entities glow white
	(Copy-and-pasted from my first mod, cuz why not)

	This skill can only be used if foodlevel > 6.

-Active Skill 3
	**Electric Beam**
	[Activate with Primary skill key]
	
	Cooldown 4s
	Cooldown Indicator On

	Shoot out a ray, max travel distance 30 blocks, cannot pass through blocks including fluids like water and non-light-blocking-block like glass.
	I used villager.death sound with pitch 2 cuz I really can't find any good sound. Comment if you have a suggestion.

	If hit an entity: 
	Cause 8 damage, passes to nearby mobs in 5 blocks and cause 8 damage.
	These mobs then passes to nearby mobs in 4 blocks and cause 6 damage.
	These mobs then passes to nearby mobs in 3 blocks and cause 6 damage.
	Note: "Passes to nearby mobs" including the mob itself.

	If hit a block:
	Pass to nearby mobs in 3 blocks of the hit block and start the above process again but with half of the damage applied.

	The damage is applied once per 4 ticks.
	Thus, since damage tick exists, a mob will not receive all 4 damages but at most two of them.
	
	Will turn normal creeper into a charged creeper if they are hit/passed-to.

	Will glow the hit/passed-to mobs, including you for 2 seconds.

-Active Skill 4
	**Railgun**
	[Right Click with iron nugget and Left Click during a suitable time.]
	
	Cooldown 10s
	Cooldown Indicator On

	Right click with an iron nugget.
	Left click during 0.75-0.9s after the right click to cast a ray.
	Will notify you with a screen overlay during that window.

	If left click too early/too late, the iron nugget will not be consumed but given back to you. 
	Cooldown is also not triggered.

	If success, shoot out a ray, max travel distance 100 blocks, cannot pass through blocks including fluids like water and non-light-blocking-block like glass.
	If hit an entity, summon a small explosion(normal creeper) and deal 100 damage("by you" enabled in this case, meaning that mobs will actually know its you who damaged them). Also apply a knockback effect.
	If hit a block, summon a big explosion consists of 15 tnts at that block.
	During the travel of the ray, summon instant-blow-up creeper with explosion radius 2, cuz it looks extra cool this way :).
	
	If successful launched, apply 40 exhaustion.

	This skill can only be used if foodlevel > 0.

	Whether this power works as intended is a mystery, cuz I got no one to test with...

	When attacking with empty hand, iron-made stuffs, lightning rod or copper ingot, 99% to deal 3 lightning damage after 10 ticks, 1% to summon a lightning bolt.
	
	When attacked with stuff other than empty hand, iron-made stuffs, lightning rod or copper ingot, or wearing armors other than iron armor/naked: 	19% to deal 2 lightning damage

	1% to drop whatever the attacker is holding
	60% nothing happens.

	39% to deal 3 lightning damage
	39 % to apply slowness 1 for 5s
	2% to drop whatever the attacker is holding
	20% nothing happens.

	When attacked with empty hand while you are not wearing any armor:
	Deal 4 lightning damage and apply slowness 1 for 5s.

	If falling more or equal than 36 blocks, hold sneak when landing to reduce fall damage by 90%.

	Fear Effect:
	-Speed 1 for 5 seconds
	-Weakness 1 for 5 seconds
	-Shaking for 8 seconds

	When health is less than 4 (2 hearts), spawn red particles so that it looks like you leave a blood trail behind.

 	Snowed effect:
  	Will trigger shaking snow.

	Trigger a shaking water effect like wolf when soaked.
	Will not trigger the shaking water effect if you are sneaking, in case you want to hide from something...

	Will also trigger a shaking snow effect when snowed.

	Water/powder snow in Cauldron only trigger shaking if block_state level > 1

	The shaking effects only take place if the respective counter does not increase for 0.5s, so that you wont spam shaking by holding space in powder snow and water.

	Evaporation:
	When no longer in-rain, water, powdered_snow, trigger a natural evaporation that remove rain/snow counter by 1 every second in the span of 100s
	If block light level > 12, on magma_block, or exposed_to_sun, the remove is by 5 everysecond, in 20s. 
	I prob don't need the time span thingy but meh..
